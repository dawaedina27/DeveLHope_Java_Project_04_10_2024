1. Create 'Calculator' interface. in this interface there should be 4 functions: Sum, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
  implement this interface from 'CalculatorClass' and implement necessary functions.
  All the classes and interface and main function should be in separate files.

2. Create inheritance chain.
  Create abstract Person Class and inherit that by Man class than inherit that Man by WorkerMan.
  Inherit Person by Woman then inherit Women by WomanWorker.
  Each class should have function: printNameAndType
  Create main function, in the main function create 6-7-8 people(each of them will be type of Man or WorkerMan or Woman or WorkerWoman)

3. Add working hours to worker classes and add a work() function.
   when we run work function we should see: "Name worked .. hours"
   All the objects will define by Person(Person objName = new Man();) somehow try to run work functions from the object that you created from Worker classes.
